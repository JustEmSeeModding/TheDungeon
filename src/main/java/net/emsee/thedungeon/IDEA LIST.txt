    High-tier dungeon gear slowly corrupts the player, granting power (e.g., +50% damage) but causing debuffs can be Cleansed to remove or reduce debuffs.

Dungeon Pets?

A hidden mini-boss who was once the dungeon’s keeper. Defeating him unlocks a secret "Creator’s Forge" to craft OP gear.

Temporary Portal?
    Starter portals that only grant single access, forcing players to scavenge quickly in the dungeon for better gear to build a permanent portal.

        new Blob Processor
        Falling crystals?
        Resonance Nodes - pulsating crystal formations that buff nearby crystal mobs or debuff players unless destroyed.

        Luminous Crawler: Passive/neutral insectoid mob made of light and crystal. Drops Luminous Dust (glowstone alternative/ingredient). Flees from loud noises/combat. Provides ambient light.

    Sculk Biome?

    Cave Lurker: Giant, blind cave-dwelling insect (like a centipede/crustacean hybrid). Relies on vibration/scent. Ambushes from ceilings/walls. Tough carapace. Drops Chitin Plates (armor).
    Rock Grub: Small, passive mob that eats stone. Leaves behind "Softened Stone" blocks that are easier to mine but collapse faster. Drops Grub Meat (food) or Grub Silk (string alternative).
    Shadow Goblin: Give them short-range teleport/blink ability (like Endermen but shorter cooldown/distance) within shadows. Maybe inflict Blindness briefly on hit. Weak to bright light (Slowness/Weakness).
    Corupted Goblin: Sculk

    HobGoblin Trading:
        Option 1: Gifts. Drop specific "Valued Items" near them (e.g., Pyrite Nuggets, Shiny Crystals, Cooked Meat, specific Goblin Totems dropped by other goblins). After enough gifts, they become neutral/tradeable for a set time. Attacking breaks reputation.
        Option 2: Totem of Truce. Craft a unique item (using rare drops like a Shaman's staff + gold + emerald) that, when held visibly, makes them passive for a short time, allowing trade. Consumable or has a cooldown.

        Pyrite Golem (Stone/Deep Biome): A massive golem made of Pyrite ore and stone. Highly resistant to physical damage, weak to magic/pickaxes? Drops large Pyrite chunks.
        Cryo-Queen (Ice Biome): A humanoid ice elemental. Creates ice spikes, blizzards (slowness/blindness), freezes water. Drops Frost Cores (for ice weapons/tools).

Implement Curios API for custom artifacts
    only custom slots, no generic belt slot etc. (debatable maybe)
    check all Curios slots for unwanted items.
    Trinket belt equipment
        a Curios equip-able belt that can hold multiple found trinkets (small passive buffs). better belts offer more slots.
